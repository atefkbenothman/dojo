## What is Dojo?

Dojo is your local AI workbench for building, chaining, and running custom tool-augmented LLM agents. It enables you to design sophisticated, multi-agent workflows to automate complex tasks by combining LLMs and specialized toolsâ€”all within your local environment.

## Key Capabilities

- **Build & Chain Custom Agents:** Define agents by selecting an LLM, crafting a system prompt (its goal/persona), and assigning it specific tools. Orchestrate sequences of these custom agents.
- **Dynamic Tool Integration (MCP):** Equip your agents (or use directly in chat) with _any_ command-line tool by defining how it's launched (command, arguments, environment).
- **Interactive LLM Chat:** Direct conversational access to LLMs, also capable of using your configured tools.
- **Local & Extensible:** Ensures privacy and allows deep customization of agents and tools.
